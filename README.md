OVERVIEW OF GAME

Our game is about a person who is lost in a completely dark, limbo-like, maze-forest environment, with only a small torch to guide them through the darkness that lights up their immediate area. They are a lone plane crash survivor who has to return to civilization by making it through the dark forest and thus the levels of the game. They will have to avoid enemy wild animals such as wolves and bears, with a mechanic of batteries (extending the torch's range) and guns being able to be picked up to fend these off. The most important mechanic is the small torchlight that surrounds the player, as it is the only means to see the environment and hopefully escape. We  have gone for a dark aesthetic, though done in pixel art, so while it may appear as cutesy pixel art at first glance, it's really a dark horror aesthetic behind this facade.
Our game is played simply controlled with the WASD control scheme so far, with E or similar hopefully implemented for use on items in the final game.

INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS

AJ -  I have set up and managed the repository, written the README, along with gathering the prior code of tile map and player movement from workshops to use as a foundation for our own, and aided in merging code to the main code.

Ollie - I have reorganised and fixed the tile map code, aided in consolidating code, in addition to suggesting the thematic and aesthetic inspiration for our project.

Huseyin - I have implemented the code for the torch mechanic, lighting the area surrounding the player, using inspiration from a tutorial I found online for guidance. 

Cherry - I have coded the items that can be picked up, using inspiration I found online for the code, as well as inputting their positions across the map and designing their appearance.

Amelia - I have found our aesthetic inspiration through a Pinterest board of images and have drawn the sprites and texture design for the player and environment, using a pixel art aesthetic throughout the designs as an art style that serves as a thematic facade. 

Bani - I helped with the narrative development and theme of the game, and I will draw and implement the code for the enemies, possibly making use of code from prior lectures, but this will only be relevant in the final version of the game, not the prototype.

THEMES

We are going for a horror, dark theme, focusing on a person lost in a dark forest with only a small light for guidance. The structure will be that of a maze, with a claustrophobic, scary environment, with all but the player's immediate area enveloped in darkness.

GAME DESIGN

The game explores themes of isolation and survival, with the player being completely alone in an almost completely dark environment save for the small spotlight from their torch. the traversal of the crampt obstacles combined with this mostly dark environment aids that feeling of isolation and the fear desired for a horror-based game. We aim to have the items fully useable, both the gun as a weapon against wild creature enemies and the batteries as a temporary increase to the torch, as well as fully implement the enemies that as of yet are not present at all. The game features the key gameplay loop of "Exploration -> Challenge -> Reward", as the player must explore the environment to find a challenge, whether that be an enemy or a new item, with a reward of survival or utilising said item.

NARRATIVE

The game starts with the player waking up in a creepy, dark forest. They have just survived a plane crash and are miles from proper civilisation. They need to survive this dark forest and make it back to civilsations, fighting off the wild creatures that may attack, while resourcefully making good use out of the batteries and guns that have fallen as debris from the crash. In the final project, it may be that we have an intro with text detailing the situation, and perhaps an outro that details their return to civilisation. We may also add detail to the environment such as debris to make it more immersive to the plane crash setting.

AESTHETIC

Our aesthetic is a dark, but pixel-art, one, as though it may appear cutesy pixel art, it is actually a dark horror-esque aesthetic given the dark ennvironment and claustrophobic obstacles layout. Enemies will also have a creepy design when implemented, and we are considering more horror elements i.e. jumpscares. Our main source of inspiration is the game Don't Starve (2013) as suggested by Ollie, as its dark and creepy aesthetic is very much what we are attempting to emulate. Furthermore, images found on Pinterest have inspired our pixel-art style and the forest environment we have portrayed. Such images can be found in the "inspoImages" directory on the repository.
