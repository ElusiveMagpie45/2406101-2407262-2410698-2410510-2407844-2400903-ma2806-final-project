OVERVIEW OF GAME
Think of this like an introduction to your game. What is your game about? What are its key mechanics? What are its main narrative
ideas and themes? What aesthetic choics did you make. 

Our game is about a person who is lost in a completely dark, limbo-like maze, forest environment, with only a small torch to guide them through the darkness that lights up their immediate area. They are a lone plane crash survivor who has to return to civilization by making it through the dark forest and thus the levels of the game. They will have to avoid enemy wild animals such as wolves and bears, with a mechanic of batteries (extending the torch's range) and guns being able to be picked up to fend these off. The most important mechanic is the small torchlight that surrounds the player, as it is the only means to see the environment and hopefully escape. 


INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS
Each group member should write their own short section outlining what they contributed
and their process. Explain what it is you contributed, how you went about it, and
what your thought process was. There is no length requirement here, but your section
should be detailed enough that I can easily identify your contributions to the
project.

AJ -  I have set up the repository and written the README, along with gathering the prior code of tile map and player movement from workshops to use as a foundation for our own.

Ollie - I have reorganised and fixed the tile map code, in addition to suggesting the thematic and aesthetic inspiration for our project.

Huseyin - I have implemented the code for the torch mechanic 

Cherry - I have coded the items that can be picked up

Amelia - I have drawn the sprites and texture design 

Bani - 

THEMES
We are going for a horror, anxious theme, focusing on a person lost in the dark with only a small light for guidance. The structure will be that of a maze, with a claustrophobic, scary environment, with all but the player's immediate area enveloped in darkness.

GAME DESIGN
Discuss the design of your game. What themes does it explore? How are these
expressed through the mechanics? What mechanics have you incorporated into the
prototype and how do you plan to develop them in the final project? Are there any
mechanics you would like to implement but could not at this stage of your project?
It may be useful to review some of the resources I sent you on game design (in the
week 17 class notes).

NARRATIVE
Discuss the narrative elements of your game and how you plan to develop these in
the final project.

AESTHETIC
Discuss your aesthetic approach and the inspirations you drew from. Upload images
to your repository and point me to the relevant directory for these, and discuss
the choices you made.
